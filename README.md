# Hello-world
developing a modified Photonic router for optical loss in photonic Network chip. 
the photonic router will used Cygnus and that is modified fro 16 microring resonators to 10 microring resonators. then traditional traffic or traffic patterns like paratec, bitreverse, cactus, random, neighbour will be used with adaptive routing algorithms like west-first, odd-even, North - last  will be used on a 5X5 mesh topology to implement this work
